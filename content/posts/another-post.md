I second this. I know a lot of elders who are fairly active outdoor and indoor seem to do better, much like plants need sunlight and fresh air. My grandma used to live in China by herself and her parish was only a few doors down. When she finally came to live with us in the U.S., she still go to church every morning, but she has to walk two blocks. After a few months, her walking has improved, and crane is now optional on the good sunny days. She eats well too (compared to what she would eat in China..) She's 88 years old today.

For many years, Chinese elders are recommended to go to senior citizen clubs, play chess games and Mahjong, do TaiChi or something alike, for better physical and mental health. The unfortunate side of the reality is many elders are disabled and have no one to get them where they need to be except getting help from senior assistance. I hope more families can spend more time with their elderly.

But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte’s work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a p tag, as seen to the right of this paragraph.

If you need a full-width figure, give it the fullwidth class. Make sure that’s inside an article, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From Beautiful Evidence, page 122-124.
